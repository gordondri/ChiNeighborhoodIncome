# ChiNeighborhoodIncome

- This repository contains an independent project I did as an exercise to demonstrate Principle Component Analysis (PCA). In an effort to do this, I applied
PCA to two public datasets stored on Chicago's Data Portal
- The merged data set shows Per Capita Income for 77 neighborhoods in Chicago. In this dataset, there are 31 predictor varaibles available

- The predictor variables have been combined from two public datasets from the City of Chicago's Data Portal:

1. "Census Data - Selected socioeconomic indicators in Chicago, 2008 - 2012" (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)

2. "Public Health Statistics- Selected public health indicators by Chicago community" (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Selected-public-health-in/iqnk-2tcu)
